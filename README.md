# Tic-tac-toe_hyperskill
This is my fifth python project on hyperskill, as a Python beginner.
I remembered the paper-and-pencil game from childhood:Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and crosses or Xs and Os. A single mistake or a miscalculation usually cause me to loose to my opponent, it is actually simple enough that most players discover the best strategy quickly. Now that I can code a little I am going to write the program Tic-Tac-Toe and get playing!
Module 5 is the working project.
So why are you wating here go to module 5 and enjoy your day by refreshing childhood memories by playing Tic-Tac-Toe.
